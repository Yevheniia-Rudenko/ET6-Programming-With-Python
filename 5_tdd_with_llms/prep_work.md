# Prep Work

This chapter's lesson plan will focus on Test-Driven Development _without_ the help of AI, why?  because:

- You should first understand TDD alone before adding LLMs
- Not everyone has access to LLMs, but everyone can practice TDD

To prepare for the workshop, read through these two documents: [Test-Driven Development](./test_driven_development.md), [Workflow without LLMs](./workflow_without_llm.md)

---

You can explore integrating LLMs into your workflow after the workshop using these resources:

- [Workflow with LLM](./workflow_with_llm.md) + [video guide](https://mit-emerging-talent.github.io/ET6-Programming-With-Python/5_tdd_with_llms/workflow_example.mp4)
- [Stepped examples](./examples/): Each of the files is a snapshot of a different step in the development process. The final product is in one file for demonstration, yours should be separated into two files.
